         li Property Name - for Add/Delete/Change actions (see article Action Type) this field will be used to specify the field name upon an action will be taken. use dots ('.') to look for properties on nested sub-documents. Not relevant for Custom operations (see article Action Type)
         li Property Value - for Add/Change actions, this is the new value that will be assigned to the property (given in article 2). for Custom operation, this field will be replaced with a textbox to hold the custom expression/function to perform on each document (in Custom operations, the fields 'Property Name' and 'Property Value' are meaning-less since the customer function will be performed on the whole document).
         li Actions - choose the action type you want to perform.
            ol
               li 'Add Property' will add a new property to each of the matching documents, with the given name (article 2) and the given value (article 3).
               li 'Delete Property' will delete the property with a given name (article 2). If the given property is not found, no errors will be thrown.
