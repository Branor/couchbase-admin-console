## Synopsis

This Web-Based tool helps administrating couchbase clusters. You can add/update/delete properties on documents matching a query, or run a custom JavaScript expression against those documents.

## Code Example

See the help page inside the web-based tool.

## Prerequisites

With your couchbase cluster, you need to install N1QL, a SQL-like engine to parse and return documents matching a SQL query.
This web-based tool runs on nodejs and serves a web application to manage the configured clusters in the config.json file.
Edit the config.json file with your own data, and see the Help page for further help.
